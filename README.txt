A simple solution to the shopping cart task.

The program aids the user with simple instructions.

The products are limited to what is specified in the Products class. Updating the price of a product can easily be done in the same class.

For this task I did not want to over complicate it, therefore some values are hardcoded but this can lead to scaling issues as calculateTotal would need to be reworked to accomodate n number of products.

Uncommenting the while loop in the main method will prompt the user to continue or quit.

There is room for improvement.
