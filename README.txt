A simple solution to the shopping cart task.


Reads a string of items from stdin and outputs the total to stdout.

For this task I did not want to complicate it, therefore some values are hardcoded but this can lead to scaling issues as calculateTotal would need to be reworked to accommodate n number of products.

This revision simplifies the solution.
